**Hello there!**

I'm m3gakr4nus.

I was born in 2003 in Tehran, Iran, and I'm currently living in Switzerland. I started coding at the age of 12 and got into actual hacking at 14. During this time, I experimented with writing malware such as keyloggers, droppers, and logic bombs in Python. I also installed Kali Linux and followed various free online courses I found on YouTube and other platforms.

My hacking journey became more serious in 2023 when I began learning about computer networking and basic IT security. Around the same time, I started participating in CTF challenges on TryHackMe, which I can confidently say taught me 80% of what I know today.
