### Flags

**Machine 1 (RED)**
1. What is the content of flag.txt in the user's home folder?

**Machine 2 (BLUE)**
1. What is the name of the backdoor user which was created on the server after exploitation?
2. What is the name of the malicious-looking package installed on the server?
3. What is the name of the plugin installed on the server after successful exploitation?

## Initial Recon
Let's start by an Nmap scan:
```console
m3ga@kali:~$ nmap -sS -Pn -v -p- -T4 -A -oN portscan.nmap 10.10.210.217
PORT      STATE SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh      OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open  http     Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: OPTIONS HEAD GET POST
|_http-title: Maintenance
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
50000/tcp open  ibm-db2?
| fingerprint-strings: 
|   drda, ibm-db2: 
|     HTTP/1.1 400 
|     Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
...
```

Looks like there are two web servers running. The target seems to be running `Ubuntu`.

The website on `port 80` seems to be under maintenance. I tried fuzzing for files and directories but found nothing. Let's move on to port `50000`.

`TeamCity Version 2023.11.3` seems to be running on this port.

## RED

### Flag 1

#### CVE-2024-27198
Looking for vulnerabilities in `TeamCity 2023.11.3 (build 147512)` I found `CVE-2024-27198`.

> [nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27198) - CVE-2024-27198
>

{: .prompt-info }

Looking for ways to exploit this, I found an article on `rapid7`.

> [rapid7.com](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/03/04/etr-cve-2024-27198-and-cve-2024-27199-jetbrains-teamcity-multiple-authentication-bypass-vulnerabilities-fixed/) - CVE-2024-27198
>

{: .prompt-tip }

Let's use `Metasploit` as shown in `rapid7` to exploit this vulnerability.

> Metasploit - `exploit/multi/http/jetbrains_teamcity_rce_cve_2024_27198`
> 
> This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity. An unauthenticated attacker can leverage this to access the REST API and create a new administrator access token.

## BLUE
### Flag 1

We are given some instructions on this one.

> **Lab Connection**

> Before moving forward, deploy the machine. When you deploy the machine, it will be assigned an IP address: 10.10.80.34. The Splunk instance will  be accessible in about 5 minutes and can be accessed at 10.10.80.34:8000 using the credentials mentioned below:
>

{: .prompt-info }

Navigating to `port 8000`, we're automatically logged in as the user `admin` which I thought was weird because we had to login as `splunk`. Anyway...

![](<Pasted image 20241005160101.png>){: w="700" h="300" .center }

Since I didn't know how to use `Splunk`, I had to do some research at this point. After getting some help from `ChatGPT` and [Splunk's own documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk), I learned what splunk is and how it can be used.

To search within log files on the system we can navigate to `Apps > Search & Reporting`

![](<Pasted image 20241005160413.png>){: w="400" h="300" .center }

Before moving forward, let's check to see what data is available to us.

![](<Pasted image 20241005160623.png>){: w="400" h="300" .center }

Inside `Files & Directories`, we find some of the log files that are available.

![](<Pasted image 20241005160728.png>){: w="600" h="300" .center }

![](<Pasted image 20241005160808.png>){: w="600" h="300" .center }

Let's go back to our search. First, I set the time frame to `All time` for now.

![](<Pasted image 20241005161034.png>){: w="450" h="300" .center }

To look for all **user creation events**, we can simply search for:

```text
source="/var/log/auth.log" useradd "new user"
```

![](<Pasted image 20241005161443.png>){: w="700" h="300" .center }

### Flag 2

> What is the name of the malicious-looking package installed on the server?

This one was a little tough for me at first. But the cool thing about `Splunk` is that you can actually create these things called `extracted fields`.

Since there is so much information to go through, you can basically highlight a piece of a log entry and turn it into a field. Then you can query and list the values of this field. Let me show you what I mean.

Installing packages is usually done with `dpkg` or `apt` on most **Debian** based machines such as Ubuntu. Looking through `/var/log/dpkg.log`, there are hundreds of log entries of various packages being removed and installed.

![](<Pasted image 20241005162235.png>){: w="700" h="300" .center }

#### Exported Fields

Let's export the package names so we can better sort and manipulate the data.

![](<Pasted image 20241005162407.png>){: w="400" h="300" .center }

Let's filter for all log entries that contain `installed`. Then, to select an reference entry, we can just click on the first one which in this case is the `man-db` package.

![](<Pasted image 20241005162643.png>){: w="400" h="300" .center }

In the next step, we have to choose either `RegEx` or `Delimiters`. Since the log entries are nicely separated with spaces, I choose `Delimiters`.

![](<Pasted image 20241005162841.png>){: w="500" h="300" .center }

Now, we can select what part the log entry we'd like to turn into a field and name it.

![](<Pasted image 20241005163103.png>){: w="700" h="300" .center }

Finally, just give it an extraction name and save it.

![](<Pasted image 20241005163252.png>){: w="500" h="300" .center }

#### Malicious package

Let's navigate back to our `Search & Reporting` app.

Looking for `installed` entries in `dpkg.log`, we now have the two extracted fields that we created.

![](<Pasted image 20241005163447.png>){: w="600" h="300" .center }

Simply click on `package_name` and set `Selected` to **yes**.

![](<Pasted image 20241005163525.png>){: w="500" h="300" .center }

Now, to only list package names we can search for:
```text
source="/var/log/dpkg.log" installed
|  table package_name
```

There are still too many packages, let's only show unique values:
```text
source="/var/log/dpkg.log" installed
|  dedup package_name 
|  table package_name
```

Still too many, let's get rid of some of the default packages that we are not interested in.
```text
source="/var/log/dpkg.log" installed NOT package_name="*lib*" NOT package_name="*linux*" NOT package_name="*unattend*" NOT package_name="*python*" NOT package_name="*ubuntu*" NOT package_name="*apache*"
|  dedup package_name 
|  table package_name
```

That's a bit cleaner. But there are still so many packages to look through.

We can set the time frame to when the backdoor user was created by the attacker. This way, we're sure to filter the list in such as way that we can find the malicious package easily.

The user was created on `7/4/24 10:32:37 PM`.

Setting the time frame to `Between 7/4/2024 00:00:00 and 7/4/2024 24:00:00`, only one package comes back which is our flag.

![](<Pasted image 20241005164758.png>){: w="700" h="300" .center }

### Flag 3

> What is the name of the plugin installed on the server after successful exploitation?

As we saw during the red part of this challenge, a plugin is uploaded to the server. Within the data imports, we saw that the log file `/opt/teamcity/TeamCity/logs/teamcity-activities.log` was available.

We can look for plugins by setting the time frame to be `7/4/2024` and search for:

```text
source="/opt/teamcity/TeamCity/logs/teamcity-activities.log" plugin
```

Only one entry comes back which contains the name of the malicious plugin.

## Outro
Many thanks to the creators of this room [Dex01](https://tryhackme.com/p/Dex01) | [strategos](https://tryhackme.com/p/strategos) | [l000g1c](https://tryhackme.com/p/l000g1c).

I don't usually enjoy blue team challenges but this one was very good. I enjoyed learning about Splunk and how the blue team can monitor and look for anomalies within logs.
